Simulations were conducted using the immersed boundary method for particle Reynolds numbers of 20–70 with an Archimedes number of 23 600. Two different flow regimes were identified as a function of the particle Reynolds number. For low particle Reynolds numbers ( $20 ), the porosity is relatively low and the particle dynamics are dominated by interparticle collisions that produce anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. The relative importance of hydrodynamic effects increases with increasing particle Reynolds number, leading to a minimized anisotropy in the particle velocity fluctuations at an intermediate particle Reynolds number. For high particle Reynolds numbers ( $Re_p  40$ ), the particle dynamics are dominated by hydrodynamic effects, leading to decreasing and more anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. A sharp increase in the anisotropy occurs when the particle Reynolds number increases from 40 to 50, corresponding to a transition from a regime in which collision and hydrodynamic effects are equally important (regime 1) to a hydrodynamic-dominated regime (regime 2). The results imply an optimum particle Reynolds number of roughly 40 for the investigated Archimedes number of 23 600 at which mixing in the reactor is expected to peak, which is consistent with reactor studies showing peak performance at a similar particle Reynolds number and with a similar Archimedes number. Results also show that maximum effective collisions are attained at intermediate particle Reynolds number. Future work is required to relate optimum particle Reynolds number to Archimedes number.","tags":[],"title":"Competing flow and collision effects in a monodispersed liquid--solid fluidized bed at a moderate Archimedes number","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo Yao","Edward Biegert","Bernhard Vowinckel","Thomas Köllner","Eckart Meiburg","S Balachandar","Craig S Criddle","Oliver B Fringer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646690918,"objectID":"5e6071315532f73a33cda076195f2619","permalink":"https://yaoyn.github.io/publication/yao-2021-fj/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T22:08:38.202742Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yao-2021-fj/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a collocated-grid method for Direct Numerical Simulations of polydisperse particles submerged in a viscous fluid.

To evaluate the validity of superposition of monodispersed reactor behavior, we evaluate the effects of bidispersity by comparing three-dimensional liquid-solid monodispersed and segregated bidipsersed fluidized beds. Simulations were conducted using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) with direct forcing in a periodic domain and with particle Reynolds numbers of 20-70 based on the largest particle diameter. We show that the volume fraction, kinematic wave speed, particle velocity fluctuations, and collisional and hydrodynamic stresses in the segregated layers of a bidispersed fluidized bed can be well approximated by the corresponding properties of a monodispersed fluidized bed. In the transition region between the layers, only the volume fraction and collision stresses monotonically decrease with height. At low Reynolds numbers, particle velocity fluctuations in the upper layers are the largest. As the particle Reynolds number increases, particle velocity fluctuations in the transition and lower layers become the largest sequentially. At intermediate particle Reynolds numbers, the hydrodynamic stresses in the transition region are greater than those in the upper and lower layers. As the particle Reynolds number increases, the difference between the hydrodynamic stresses in the transition layer and the two layers becomes more significant. This work demonstrates that, despite the clear segregation into layers that behave like monodispersed beds, the transition region is governed by complex bidispersed mechanisms that cannot be explained in terms of the particle behavior in the segregated layers. Overall, particle dynamics of the segregated layers in the bidispersed fluidized bed can be approximated with the corresponding monodispersed layers. The result implies that industrial applications such as wastewater treatment performance in bidispersed or polydispersed fluidized beds can be predicted with results from past numerical or experimental studies of monodispersed fluidized beds.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of the properties of segregated layers in a bidispersed fluidized bed to those of a monodispersed fluidized bed","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo Yao","Craig S Criddle","Oliver B Fringer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646690918,"objectID":"572ea5efde9e139e0e9813ef24a1065b","permalink":"https://yaoyn.github.io/publication/yao-2021-ex/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T22:08:38.635902Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yao-2021-ex/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the effects of Archimedes number Ar and volume fraction $\\phi$ in three-dimensional, high concentration and monodispersed particle suspensions. Simulations were conducted using the immersed boundary method with direct forcing for triply periodic cases and with Ar=21−23600 and $\\phi=0.22−0.43$. We find that cluster formation is strongly dependent on the Archimedes number but weakly dependent on the volume fraction for concentrated suspensions. Particles in low Ar cases are characterized by less frequent but long-lived clusters, resulting in higher hindered settling, while high Ar cases consist of more frequent but short-lived clusters, leading to reduced hindered settling. By quantifying the effects of collisions on the hydrodynamic fluctuations, we show that the lifespan of clusters for the low Ar cases is longer because particles are subject to appreciable wake interactions without collisions. On the other hand, clusters for high Ar cases are broken before being subject to appreciable wake interactions due to frequent collisions, leading to a shorter cluster lifespan. The results imply that there exists an Ar for particles in fluidized bed reactors that can reduce short circuiting due to clustering and enhance performance by maximizing flow–particle interactions. This result is consistent with existing reactor studies demonstrating that optimal particle diameters and Ar values correspond to cases with short-lived clusters, although more thorough experimental studies are needed.","tags":[],"title":"The effects of particle clustering on hindered settling in high-concentration particle suspensions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo Yao*","Zhiyue Wang","Craig S Criddle"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646690919,"objectID":"faf1bdea867402ab882a2484e44648f9","permalink":"https://yaoyn.github.io/publication/yao-2021-xo/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T22:08:39.07705Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yao-2021-xo/","section":"publication","summary":"Nitrogen is commonly removed from wastewater by nitrification to nitrate followed by nitrate reduction to N2. Shortcut N removal saves energy by limiting ammonia oxidation to nitrite, but nitrite accumulation can be unstable. We hypothesized that repeated short-term exposures of ammonia-oxidizing communities to free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA) would stabilize nitritation by selecting against nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Accordingly, we evaluated ammonium oxidation of anaerobic digester centrate in two bench-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), seeded with the same inoculum and operated identically but with differing pH-control strategies. A single stressor SBR (SS/SBR) using pH set-point control produced HNO3, while a dual stressor SBR (DS/SBR) using timed alkalinity addition (TAA) produced HNO2 (ammonium removal efficiency of 97 ± 2%; nitrite accumulation ratio of 98 ± 1%). The TAA protocol was developed during an adaptation period with continuous pH monitoring. After adaptation, automated TAA enabled stable nitritation without set-point control. In the SS/SBR, repeatedly exposing the community to FA (8-10 h/exposure, one exposure/cycle) selected for FA-tolerant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp. NM107) and NOB (Nitrobacter sp.). In the DS/SBR, repeatedly exposing the community to FA (2-4 h/exposure, three exposures/cycle) and FNA (4-6 h/exposure, two exposures/cycle) selected for FA- and FNA-resistant AOB (Nitrosomonas IWT514) and against NOB, stabilizing nitritation.","tags":[],"title":"Robust Nitritation of Anaerobic Digester Centrate Using Dual Stressors and Timed Alkali Additions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiyue Wang","Yinuo Yao","Nick Steiner","Hai-Hsuan Cheng","Yi-Ju Wu","Sung-Geun Woo","Craig S Criddle"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646690919,"objectID":"87b91b3d9288bd981bbc1a53112f573c","permalink":"https://yaoyn.github.io/publication/wang-2020-kp/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T22:08:39.346327Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2020-kp/","section":"publication","summary":"Nitritation of anaerobic digestion centrate reduces aeration energy demand by preventing oxidation to nitrate and can be affected by changes in upstream processing of anaerobic digestate.

The pilot reactor selected for a stable microbial community with nitritation of 60–65% of influent TKN; ∼30–35% nitrogen removal; low nitrate concentrations; and concurrent appearance of autotrophic and heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB).

The effects of coagulant dosage on nitritation were studied in bench-scale sequencing batch bioreactors (SBRs), where unclassified AOB were identified that had amoA sequences clustering between the autotrophic and heterotrophic clades. Heterotrophic nitritation was stimulated by glucose addition, especially in SBR biomass adapted to continuous coagulant addition, with elevated levels of Xanthomonadaceae, Chitinophagaceae, and Rhodanobacteraceae.

Because ammonia oxidation is well-studied, tests of CANDO to date have focused on N2O production in anaerobic/anoxic sequencing batch reactors. In these reactors, nitrogen is provided as nitrite; PHA is produced from acetate or other dissolved COD, and PHA oxidation is coupled to N2O production from nitrite. In a pilot-scale study, N2O recovery was affected by COD/N ratio, total cycle time, and relative time periods for PHA synthesis and N2O production. In follow-up bench-scale studies, different reactor cycle times were used to investigate these operational parameters. Increasing COD/N ratio improved nitrite removal and increased biosolids concentration. Shortening the anaerobic phase prevented fermentation of PHA and improved its utilization. Efficient PHA synthesis and utilization in the anaerobic phase correlated with high N2O production in the anoxic phase. Shortening the anoxic phase prevented reduction of N2O to N2. By shortening both phases, total cycle time was reduced from 24 to 12 h. This optimized operation enabled increased biomass concentrations, increased N2O yields (from 71 to 87%), increased N loading rates (from 0.1 to 0.25 kg N/m3-d), and shorter hydraulic residence times (from 10 to 2 days). Long-term changes in operational performance for the different bioreactor systems tested were generally similar despite significant differences in microbial community structure. Long-term operation at short anaerobic phases selected for a glycogen-accumulating community dominated by a Defluviicoccus-related strain.","tags":[],"title":"Nitrogen removal as nitrous oxide for energy recovery: Increased process stability and high nitrous yields at short hydraulic residence times","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kok Kwang Ng","Xueqing Shi","Yinuo Yao","How Yong Ng"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1414800000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646690919,"objectID":"b3eeeaa6ed08f64382237fd20157f56f","permalink":"https://yaoyn.github.io/publication/ng-2014-ol/","publishdate":"2022-03-07T22:08:38.840063Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ng-2014-ol/","section":"publication","summary":"In this study, a bio-entrapped membrane reactor (BEMR) and a salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor (SMSMBR) were evaluated to study the organic treatment performance of pharmaceutical wastewater.
