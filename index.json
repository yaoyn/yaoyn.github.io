While this has the potential to transform domestic wastewater treatment into an energy positive process, the moving particles in the SAF-MBR induce hydrodynamic processes related to flow-particle and particle-particle interactions that are poorly understood. With a better understanding of hydrodynamics, better design and operational practices can be developed. To overcome this, a collocated particle resolved simulation (PRS) using the immersed boundary method (IBM) is developed to accurately quantify the fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions in a fluidized-bed reactor.We first investigate the effect of particle Reynolds number which is essentially a nondimensional flow rate that controls the bed expansion. Results imply the existence of an intermediate particle Reynolds number regime at which the combined effect of flow and collisions is optimal and both mixing in the AFBR and membrane scouring in the P-MBR are expected to be maximized. While the Reynolds number is a critical parameter, the design of fluidized beds depends critically on the Archimedes number that combines the effect of particle and fluid properties. Simulation results reveal that particles with Archimedes number greater than roughly 1000 should be used to avoid flow short-circuiting due to clusters in the AFBR and reduced membrane scouring due to ineffective collisions in the P-MBR. In industrial applications, fluidized beds typically contain particles of different sizes that tend to segregate into layers in which the particle size increases moving upward.

Simulations were conducted using the immersed boundary method for particle Reynolds numbers of 20–70 with an Archimedes number of 23 600. Two different flow regimes were identified as a function of the particle Reynolds number. For low particle Reynolds numbers ( $20 ), the porosity is relatively low and the particle dynamics are dominated by interparticle collisions that produce anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. The relative importance of hydrodynamic effects increases with increasing particle Reynolds number, leading to a minimized anisotropy in the particle velocity fluctuations at an intermediate particle Reynolds number. For high particle Reynolds numbers ( $Re_p \u003e 40$ ), the particle dynamics are dominated by hydrodynamic effects, leading to decreasing and more anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. A sharp increase in the anisotropy occurs when the particle Reynolds number increases from 40 to 50, corresponding to a transition from a regime in which collision and hydrodynamic effects are equally important (regime 1) to a hydrodynamic-dominated regime (regime 2). The results imply an optimum particle Reynolds number of roughly 40 for the investigated Archimedes number of 23 600 at which mixing in the reactor is expected to peak, which is consistent with reactor studies showing peak performance at a similar particle Reynolds number and with a similar Archimedes number. Results also show that maximum effective collisions are attained at intermediate particle Reynolds number. Future work is required to relate optimum particle Reynolds number to Archimedes number.","tags":[],"title":"Competing flow and collision effects in a monodispersed liquid--solid fluidized bed at a moderate Archimedes number","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo Yao","Ankun Wang","Ilenia Battiato","Meagan S.

To evaluate the validity of superposition of monodispersed reactor behavior, we evaluate the effects of bidispersity by comparing three-dimensional liquid-solid monodispersed and segregated bidipsersed fluidized beds. Simulations were conducted using the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) with direct forcing in a periodic domain and with particle Reynolds numbers of 20-70 based on the largest particle diameter. We show that the volume fraction, kinematic wave speed, particle velocity fluctuations, and collisional and hydrodynamic stresses in the segregated layers of a bidispersed fluidized bed can be well approximated by the corresponding properties of a monodispersed fluidized bed. In the transition region between the layers, only the volume fraction and collision stresses monotonically decrease with height. At low Reynolds numbers, particle velocity fluctuations in the upper layers are the largest. As the particle Reynolds number increases, particle velocity fluctuations in the transition and lower layers become the largest sequentially. At intermediate particle Reynolds numbers, the hydrodynamic stresses in the transition region are greater than those in the upper and lower layers. As the particle Reynolds number increases, the difference between the hydrodynamic stresses in the transition layer and the two layers becomes more significant. This work demonstrates that, despite the clear segregation into layers that behave like monodispersed beds, the transition region is governed by complex bidispersed mechanisms that cannot be explained in terms of the particle behavior in the segregated layers. Overall, particle dynamics of the segregated layers in the bidispersed fluidized bed can be approximated with the corresponding monodispersed layers. The result implies that industrial applications such as wastewater treatment performance in bidispersed or polydispersed fluidized beds can be predicted with results from past numerical or experimental studies of monodispersed fluidized beds.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of the properties of segregated layers in a bidispersed fluidized bed to those of a monodispersed fluidized bed","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo Yao","Craig S.

We find that cluster formation is strongly dependent on the Archimedes number but weakly dependent on the volume fraction for concentrated suspensions. Particles in low Ar cases are characterized by less frequent but long-lived clusters, resulting in higher hindered settling, while high Ar cases consist of more frequent but short-lived clusters, leading to reduced hindered settling. By quantifying the effects of collisions on the hydrodynamic fluctuations, we show that the lifespan of clusters for the low Ar cases is longer because particles are subject to appreciable wake interactions without collisions. On the other hand, clusters for high Ar cases are broken before being subject to appreciable wake interactions due to frequent collisions, leading to a shorter cluster lifespan. The results imply that there exists an Ar for particles in fluidized bed reactors that can reduce short circuiting due to clustering and enhance performance by maximizing flow–particle interactions. This result is consistent with existing reactor studies demonstrating that optimal particle diameters and Ar values correspond to cases with short-lived clusters, although more thorough experimental studies are needed.","tags":[],"title":"The effects of particle clustering on hindered settling in high-concentration particle suspensions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo Yao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1615766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615766400,"objectID":"3d0d0e336d3f9c220c025b4b4e122eac","permalink":"https://yaoyn.github.io/invitedtalks/ucb-2021/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/invitedtalks/ucb-2021/","section":"invitedtalks","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Using particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations to optimize wastewater treatment systems: Shrinking the parameter space to accelerate reactor optimization","type":"invitedtalks"},{"authors":["Yinuo Yao","Zhiyue Wang","Craig S.

We hypothesized that repeated short-term exposures of ammonia-oxidizing communities to free ammonia (FA) and free nitrous acid (FNA) would stabilize nitritation by selecting against nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Accordingly, we evaluated ammonium oxidation of anaerobic digester centrate in two bench-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), seeded with the same inoculum and operated identically but with differing pH-control strategies. A single stressor SBR (SS/SBR) using pH set-point control produced HNO3, while a dual stressor SBR (DS/SBR) using timed alkalinity addition (TAA) produced HNO2 (ammonium removal efficiency of 97 ± 2%; nitrite accumulation ratio of 98 ± 1%). The TAA protocol was developed during an adaptation period with continuous pH monitoring. After adaptation, automated TAA enabled stable nitritation without set-point control. In the SS/SBR, repeatedly exposing the community to FA (8-10 h/exposure, one exposure/cycle) selected for FA-tolerant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp. NM107) and NOB (Nitrobacter sp.).

The pilot reactor selected for a stable microbial community with nitritation of 60–65% of influent TKN; ∼30–35% nitrogen removal; low nitrate concentrations; and concurrent appearance of autotrophic and heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB).

The effects of coagulant dosage on nitritation were studied in bench-scale sequencing batch bioreactors (SBRs), where unclassified AOB were identified that had amoA sequences clustering between the autotrophic and heterotrophic clades. Heterotrophic nitritation was stimulated by glucose addition, especially in SBR biomass adapted to continuous coagulant addition, with elevated levels of Xanthomonadaceae, Chitinophagaceae, and Rhodanobacteraceae.

Because ammonia oxidation is well-studied, tests of CANDO to date have focused on N2O production in anaerobic/anoxic sequencing batch reactors. In these reactors, nitrogen is provided as nitrite; PHA is produced from acetate or other dissolved COD, and PHA oxidation is coupled to N2O production from nitrite. In a pilot-scale study, N2O recovery was affected by COD/N ratio, total cycle time, and relative time periods for PHA synthesis and N2O production. In follow-up bench-scale studies, different reactor cycle times were used to investigate these operational parameters. Increasing COD/N ratio improved nitrite removal and increased biosolids concentration. Shortening the anaerobic phase prevented fermentation of PHA and improved its utilization. Efficient PHA synthesis and utilization in the anaerobic phase correlated with high N2O production in the anoxic phase. Shortening the anoxic phase prevented reduction of N2O to N2. By shortening both phases, total cycle time was reduced from 24 to 12 h. This optimized operation enabled increased biomass concentrations, increased N2O yields (from 71 to 87%), increased N loading rates (from 0.1 to 0.25 kg N/m3-d), and shorter hydraulic residence times (from 10 to 2 days). Long-term changes in operational performance for the different bioreactor systems tested were generally similar despite significant differences in microbial community structure. Long-term operation at short anaerobic phases selected for a glycogen-accumulating community dominated by a Defluviicoccus-related strain.","tags":[],"title":"Nitrogen removal as nitrous oxide for energy recovery: Increased process stability and high nitrous yields at short hydraulic residence times","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yinuo Yao","Oliver B.

The influences of hydraulic retention time (HRT) and salinity were also studied. The conventional biomass in the BEMR cannot tolerate well of the hypersaline conditions, resulting in total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal efficiency of 54.2-68.0%. On the other hand, microorganisms in the SMSMBR, which was seeded from coastal shore, strived and was able to degrade the complex organic in the presence of salt effectively, achieving 74.7-90.9% of TCOD removal efficiencies. Marine microorganisms able to degrade recalcitrant compounds and utilize hydrocarbon compounds were found in the SMSMBR, which resulted in higher organic removal efficiency than the BEMR. However, specific nitrifying activity decreased and inhibited due to the saline effect that led to poor ammonia nitrogen removal.","tags":[],"title":"Bio-entrapped membrane reactor and salt marsh sediment membrane bioreactor for the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater: treatment performance and microbial communities","type":"publication"}]
