At Stanford, I am co-advised by Prof. Craig Criddle and Prof. Oliver Fringer conducted research at the interface of fluid dynamics and environmental biotechnology to address the sustainability issues in the 21st century. Outside research and the lab, I enjoy playing tennis and hiking and have also been reading mangas since my teenage years.\n  Download my resumé.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Yinuo Yao (Noah) is a postdoctoral researcher, advised by Prof. Ilenia Battiato in Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University.
