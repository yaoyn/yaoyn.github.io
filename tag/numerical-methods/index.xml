      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Staged Anaerobic Fluidized-bed Membrane Bioreactor (SAF-MBR), which consists of an anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor
(AFBR) and a particle-sparged membrane bioreactor (P-MBR), has been developed to reduce the energy intensity of domestic wastewater
treatment by using anaerobic microorganisms that convert organics into methane in the absence of aeration. While this has the
potential to transform domestic wastewater treatment into an energy positive process, the moving particles in the SAF-MBR induce
hydrodynamic processes related to flow-particle and particle-particle interactions that are poorly understood. With a better
understanding of hydrodynamics, better design and operational practices can be developed. To overcome this, a collocated particle resolved
simulation (PRS) using the immersed boundary method (IBM) is developed to accurately quantify the fluid-particle and
particle-particle interactions in a fluidized-bed reactor.We first investigate the effect of particle Reynolds
number which is essentially a nondimensional flow rate that controls the bed expansion. Results imply the existence of an
intermediate particle Reynolds number regime at which the combined effect of flow and collisions is optimal and both mixing in the
AFBR and membrane scouring in the P-MBR are expected to be maximized. While the Reynolds number is a critical parameter, the design
of fluidized beds depends critically on the Archimedes number that combines the effect of particle and fluid properties. Simulation
results reveal that particles with Archimedes number greater than roughly 1000 should be used to avoid flow short-circuiting due to
clusters in the AFBR and reduced membrane scouring due to ineffective collisions in the P-MBR. In industrial applications, fluidized
beds typically contain particles of different sizes that tend to segregate into layers in which the particle size increases moving
upward. Our simulations reveal that segregated layers behave identically as they would in their corresponding monodispersed
fluidized bed layers. However, the transition region between the two segregated layers cannot be described as a simple superposition
of the two segregated layers&lt;/p&gt;
